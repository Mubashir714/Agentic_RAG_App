# 🤖 Agentic RAG Model

A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model that leverages **LangChain**, **Pinecone Database**, and **OpenAI Embeddings** to build an intelligent system capable of answering queries based on the **USA Constitution** dataset. This project is hosted on **Google Colab** for easy accessibility and experimentation.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **LangChain Framework**: For efficient query management and chaining tasks.
- **Pinecone Database**: High-performance vector database to store and retrieve embeddings.
- **OpenAI Embeddings**: Powering semantic search and relevance ranking for your queries.
- **USA Constitution Dataset**: Utilized from [Hugging Face Dataset](c4lliope/us-congress) to train the model and provide meaningful responses.

## 📖 How It Works

1. **Dataset Preprocessing**: 
   - The USA Constitution dataset is segmented into manageable chunks and embedded using OpenAI Embeddings.

2. **Storage**: 
   - The embeddings are stored in Pinecone, allowing for fast and accurate similarity search.

3. **Query Handling**:
   - LangChain is used to process user queries, retrieve relevant information from the database, and generate natural language responses.

4. **Response Generation**:
   - The model retrieves the most relevant embeddings and generates coherent answers using OpenAI's GPT.
